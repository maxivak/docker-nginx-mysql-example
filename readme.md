Build and run Docker containers with [docker-builder](https://github.com/maxivak/docker-builder).

Two containers: Nginx + MySQL.


# Quickstart

* edit config.rb

* since we use base images for nginx and mysql from docker repository - building of images is not needed

* run containers
```
docker-builder up
```

it will run Docker containers for nginx and mysql



# Configuration

edit config.rb
